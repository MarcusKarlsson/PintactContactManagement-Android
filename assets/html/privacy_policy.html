                                    <p>Because of the changing nature of privacy laws, user needs, and our business, we may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.

A pixel is a line of code that is used by a website or third party to assign online activities to a computer or browser.

When you use our Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to you which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Pintact.<br />A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

                                <h2>III. Children's Privacy</h2>
                                    <p>We are mindful and sensitive to the issue of children's privacy. Therefore, our Services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children. If you believe your child has provided us with personal information and/or is using our Application, and you would like to have their information removed from our servers, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@pintact.com" target="_blank">support@pintact.com</a>.</p>

                                <h2>IV. Third-Party Websites/Applications</h2>
                                    <p>A link from our own website to another website does not imply our endorsement of that website. We do not control the websites to which we link and assume no responsibility for their content or privacy policies. Therefore, you should carefully review the privacy policies that apply to any websites you access from our website.</p>

                                <h2>V. Information Security</h2>
                                    <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect against the unauthorized access to, retention of, and disclosure of data. This includes undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and management activities required to protect data integrity, access, and use. Any data that is stored on our servers is treated as confidential information. Please keep in mind, however, that despite these reasonable efforts to protect data on our servers, no method of transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your data at all times, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and shall not be liable for any breach of security by an outside party.</p>

                                <h2>VI. California</h2>
                                    <p>Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California can obtain certain information about the types of personally identifiable information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. In particular, the law provides that companies must inform consumers about the categories of personal information that have been shared with third parties, the names and addresses of those third parties, and examples of the types of services or products marketed by those third parties. To request a copy of the information disclosure provided by Pintact pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, please contact us via the email or address stated below. Please allow 30 days for a response.</p>
                                    <p>California law requires us to disclose how we respond to Web browser "Do Not Track" signals or other choice mechanisms relating to interest-based advertising. Currently, there is no industry consensus with respect to the meaning of a "Do Not Track" signal and how operators of online services should respond to them. As a result, we have not yet developed a response to browser "Do Not Track" signals, and do not change any of our data collection practices when we receive such signals. We will continue to evaluate potential responses to "Do Not Track" signals in light of industry developments or legal changes. </p>

                                <h2>VII. Questions or Comments about this Privacy Policy</h2>

                                <h2>VIII. Changes to This Privacy Policy and Additional Information</h2>
                                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and so you should review this Policy periodically. If there are material changes to Pintact's information practices, you will be provided with appropriate online notice.</p>
