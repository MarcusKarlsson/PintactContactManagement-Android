                                <h2>Is Pintact safe and secure to use?</h2>
                                <p>Yes. <b>Pintact was specifically developed to enhance users' privacy</b>. With Pintact, you are in control of your contact information by creating your own unique profiles. You determine what information you want to share and with whom. You can be searchable in the Pintact directory, or you can choose to remain anonymous &ndash; it's completely up to you.</p>
                                <p>The mobile and web applications are password protected and all the information resides on secure servers with HTTPS data encryption.</p>
                                <p>The user retains control of personal information through the creation of one or more profiles and the ability to share (or not) that contact data with other members.</p>

                                <h2>Will I receive spam messages when I become a Pintact user?</h2>
                                <p>No. Pintact values your privacy above all. Any communication which you receive as a function of your being a Pintact member will only follow your specifically requesting to receive that information ("opting-in").</p>

                                <p>During initial registration, you are prompted to create a profile that you can choose to share with other Pintact members. This profile can contain as much or as little contact information as you want. You can include a digital photo and even notes that will be shared with your Pintacts. Remember, you control what you want to share and with whom.</p>
                                <p>You can create as many additional profiles as you like from the Profiles dashboard. Make one or more and call them:  Home, Work, School, Club, Team, Vacation, Complete, Personal, etc. &ndash; it's up to you!</p>
                                <p>And whenever you change information in any of your profiles, that information will be <i>automatically</i> updated for anyone with whom you've shared that profile. They will be notified a change was made, and what information was updated.</p>

                                <p>Once processed, all members will now have each of the other members' profiles accessible in the "Labels" section of the left deck navigation menu.
