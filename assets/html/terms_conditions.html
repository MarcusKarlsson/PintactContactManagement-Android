                                    <li>The Service allows users to submit, modify, update and delete their dynamic Pintact contact information (collectively, the "User Submissions"), submit contact information for others, as well as obtain contact information from other Pintact users. These User Submissions may be hosted, shared, and/or published as part of the Service, and may be visible to other users of the Service who you agreed to connect to through the Pintact Services. You acknowledge and agree that your User Submissions may be viewed by other users with whom you have shared such data. You retain your ownership rights in your User Submissions. You understand that Pintact does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any User Submissions. You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of sharing them. User Submissions do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of Pintact, and Pintact makes no guarantees as to the validity, accuracy or legal status of any User Submission. In connection with your User Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Pintact to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to your User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and this License; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each identifiable individual person referenced in your User Submission to use their name and likeness in your User Submission. You hereby grant every user of the Service with whom you are connected a non-exclusive license to access your User Submissions through the Service. You further agree that you will not violate any of the restrictions listed in Prohibited Uses set forth in Section 6.b. below. Pintact does not endorse any User Submissions or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and we expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with User Submissions.</li>
                                    <li>Pursuant to this license, and in accordance with your settings, Pintact may grant other members of Pintact access to your content and information. You choose which members of the Pintact community with whom to share your contact information.</li>
                                    <li>In the course of using the Service, you may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Nevertheless, you agree to use our Service at your sole risk and we shall not have any liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree not to exploit the Service in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, trespassing or burdening network capacity.</li>
                                    <li>Any content or information you submit to us is at your own risk of loss.

                                    <li>It is your responsibility to keep your Pintact contact profile information accurate and updated.</li>
                                    <li>We make no representation that our Service is available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to access our Service, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. We reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to our Service at any time without notice. In no event will we be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to our Service. We may also impose limits on the use of or access to our Service without notice or liability.</li>
                                    <li>Pintact may automatically check your version of the Application. Pintact has no obligation to make available any updates.

If you send any Feedback to Pintact through the Site, social networks or otherwise, you acknowledge and agree that Pintact shall not be under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to the Feedback and nothing in this License limits or restricts Pintact's right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating the Feedback or otherwise.</li>
                                    <li>You may link to the Site from another website owned by you, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it.

Pintact may revoke the permission to link to the Site at any time at its sole discretion.</li>
